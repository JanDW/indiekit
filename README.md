Learn more about this project on the [documentation site](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/).

## Local development

```
npm start
```

If you want to run the service locally, perhaps to use with a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), ensure the [required environment variables](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/deploy) have been set.

If youâ€™re developing a new feature and want the application to automatically restart whenever a file change is detected, you can use `npm run dev`.

## Tests

```
npm test
```

Before running any automated tests, an IndieAuth token needs to be assigned to the `TEST_INDIEAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. This token, whose URL *should* match that used for `INDIEKIT_URL`, should also include `create`, `update` and `delete` scopes. [Homebrew Access Token](https://gimme-a-token.5eb.nl) is a useful tool for creating tokens for this purpose.
