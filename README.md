# IndieKit

[![Build status](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/actions) [![Coverage status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit?branch=master)

IndieKit is a configurable [Micropub](https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/) endpoint that allows you to save posts to GitHub for subsequent publishing with a static site generator.

‚úèÔ∏è **Create posts** with JSON or `x-www-form-urlencoded` syntaxes

üîÑ **Update posts** by adding, replacing or removing properties

‚ùå **Delete posts** with support for `delete` and `undelete` actions

üñº **Upload media** via the media endpoint or by including `multipart/form-data` in a request

üåà **Configure** post templates, destination paths and commit messages.

Support for additional social publishing specifications (Webmention, Microsub, ActivityPub etc.) and content management systems is planned for future releases.

## Getting started

IndieKit needs to be hosted on a public server so that it can accept and respond to requests.

### Deploy to Heroku‚Ä¶

The easiest way to do this is to deploy this application to Heroku. Clicking on the button below will guide you through the process:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/indiekit)

### ‚Ä¶or host on your own web server

If you‚Äôd like to deploy this application on your own server, first make sure it supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v10 or above).

1. Install the application

  ```
  npm i @indiekit/app
  ```

2. Ensure the following environment variables have been set:

  * `INDIEKIT_URL`: URL of the website you want to publish to.
  * `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
  * `GITHUB_USER`: Username on GitHub.
  * `GITHUB_REPO`: Name of the repository files will be saved to.

3. Start the application:

  ```
  node @indiekit/app
  ```

4. Browser to `https://<your-endpoint>/help` for information about how to configure IndieKit to publish to your website.

### Enable automatic discovery

For your Micropub (and token) endpoints to be discoverable to Micropub clients, the following values should be in your website‚Äôs `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth">
<link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token">
<link rel="micropub" href="https://<your-endpoint>/micropub">
```

## Configuring IndieKit

IndieKit respects the following environment variables:

### IndieKit
* `INDIEKIT_URL`: URL of the website you want to publish to. **Required**.
* `INDIEKIT_CONFIG_PATH`: Location of configuration file in your repo, relative to its root. *Optional*, if not provided, default values will be used for templates and file paths.
* `INDIEKIT_LOCALE`: Locale with which to format dates. *Optional*, defaults to `en-GB`.
* `INDIEKIT_CACHE_EXPIRES`: Time (in seconds) before cached publication config and post templates are refetched. *Optional*, defaults to `86400` (1 day).

### IndieAuth
* `INDIEAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`: IndieAuth token endpoint. *Optional*, defaults [`https://tokens.indieauth.com/token`](https://tokens.indieauth.com/token)

### GitHub
* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). **Required**.
* `GITHUB_USER`: Username on GitHub. **Required**.
* `GITHUB_REPO`: Name of the repository files will be saved to. **Required**.
* `GITHUB_BRANCH`: Name of the branch files will be saved to. *Optional*, defaults to `master`.

## Local development

```
npm start
```

If you want to run the service locally, perhaps to use with a tool like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), ensure the [required environment variables](https://paulrobertlloyd.github.io/indiekit/deploy) have been set.

If you‚Äôre developing a new feature and want the application to automatically restart whenever a file change is detected, you can use `npm run dev`.

### Testing

```
npm test
```

Before running any automated tests, an IndieAuth token needs to be assigned to the `TEST_INDIEAUTH_TOKEN` environment variable. This token, whose URL must match that used for `INDIEKIT_URL`, should also include `create`, `update` and `delete` scopes. [Homebrew Access Token](https://gimme-a-token.5eb.nl) is a useful tool for creating tokens for this purpose.
